<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently based in Woodbridge, Va. I pursued a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with a concentration in UI/UX Design, Fundamentals of Computing and Product Innovation at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>

<p>Opening and operating my own business has been a goal of mine since my childhood. I entered college with the dream of becoming an entrepreneur. Originally, I focused on business studies with a concentration in entrepreneurship but I felt limited and  wanted to explore more career options. So in my free time I began learning many skills in computer programming, design, web and business development. I gained experience in business by creating clothing and beard oil. I acquired graphic design skills while creating logos, thumbnails, and ads. By learning computer programming and creating web design I also built websites. I began to enjoy and spend many hours on these activities which led to me pursing a degree in Interdisiciplinary Studies. </p>

<p>Now, I have goals to help businesses develop, innovate, and solve problems by researching, collaborating, and introducing ideas that cultivate creative juices for business success and to enhance human potential.</p>
